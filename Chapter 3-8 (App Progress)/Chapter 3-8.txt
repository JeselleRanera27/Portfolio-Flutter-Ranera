Chapter 3: Planning the Structure of My App

In Chapter 3, I started by thinking about the overall flow of Budget Buddy. I mapped out how I wanted users to navigate between different sections of the app, from tracking expenses to setting budgets and viewing insights. The BudgetBuddyHomePage became the heart of the app, acting as the starting point for all other features. I used smooth transitions like SlideTransition and FadeTransition to guide users through the app, ensuring everything felt seamless and intuitive as they moved from one screen to the next.

Chapter 4: Creating a Template for My App

Once I had the basic flow mapped out, Chapter 4 was all about designing the template for Budget Buddy. This meant creating the layout and structure that would support key features like expense tracking and budget settings. I used Containers, Columns, and Text widgets to organize the screen elements in a way that made sense for the user. The background image, set with the Stack widget, added depth and helped create a visually appealing atmosphere. I focused on making the app easy to navigate, with a clear layout that supported a smooth user experience.

Chapter 5: Understanding How Widgets Work

In Chapter 5, I took a deep dive into understanding how Flutter’s widget system works. This chapter was crucial because it helped me understand how to manage the dynamic aspects of the app. I worked with StatefulWidgets to make sure the app responded to user inputs in real-time, such as pressing buttons or changing screens. The AnimationController allowed me to create smooth animations, and I realized that everything in Flutter is made up of widgets, whether it’s a button, a text field, or a whole screen. This knowledge was essential as I began designing the interactive features of Budget Buddy.

Chapter 6: Styling My App

Now that I had the structure in place, Chapter 6 was where I focused on the visual aspects of Budget Buddy. I gave the app its style, from choosing fonts with GoogleFonts.poppinsTextTheme() to adding color gradients with LinearGradient for buttons. This wasn’t just about aesthetics—I wanted the app to feel polished and cohesive. The design needed to reflect the purpose of the app, while also providing a pleasant user experience. By carefully choosing colors, fonts, and design elements, I made sure that the app was not only functional but also visually appealing.

Chapter 7: Animating My App

Chapter 7 was all about breathing life into Budget Buddy through animations. I used AnimationController and Tween objects to create fluid animations that made the app feel dynamic. For example, I applied SlideTransition and FadeTransition to give users visual cues as they navigated through the app. Animations weren’t just for decoration—they helped guide the user’s attention, made interactions more intuitive, and gave the app a sense of personality. By adding these effects, I made sure Budget Buddy wasn’t just another static app, but one that responded to users in an engaging way.

Chapter 8: Creating An Apps Navigation

Building navigation for BudgetBuddy was a pivotal step in its development. I aimed to create an interface where users, especially students like myself, could easily track expenses, set budget goals, and view spending insights—all with just a few taps.I worked on implementing links and buttons that made transitions between sections smooth and straightforward
