Chapter 2: Testing VS Code with a Simple Hello World App
After setting up my development environment for Budget Buddy, I wanted to make sure everything was working as expected before diving into the actual app development. To do this, I tested Visual Studio Code (VS Code) by creating a simple "Hello World" app using Flutter.

This step wasnâ€™t just about testing the tools, it was about building confidence. Running the app and seeing "Hello World" displayed on the screen felt like a small but meaningful achievement. It confirmed that all the extensions were properly installed, the code was compiling without errors, and the setup was ready for real development work.

This experience gave me reassurance that I could move forward with Budget Buddy without any major issues holding me back. It may have been a basic test, but it laid the groundwork for the much bigger challenges ahead.
